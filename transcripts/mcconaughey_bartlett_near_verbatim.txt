Matthew: I think too many people quit too early and we give oursel the options in the parachutes and things like relationships and work self-help and we pull at some when we could still be flying even though maybe rocky flight we pull it early and okay it's a safe move got down to the ground what I was building didn't last but most of the time it could if you'd hung in there but if you have any ambition resistance is going to come and so own that.

Steven: Matthew, you’ve been able to climb to the very top of the mountain again and again and again. Is this natural talent or is there anything transferable?

Matthew: First to look at what's in your DNA. Like I wanted to play basketball, but no matter how hard I worked, I was not the fastest nor the biggest. To look at what do you have an innate ability for? Then what are you willing to hustle for? And this is very important because some of us have innate ability, but we don't work for it. We grew up hardcore on hustle, hustle, hustle. Sleep was sin in my household and no TV. Mom would always say, "Why are you going to watch someone doing something when you can go out in the world and do it yourself?" And then number three, endurance. I remember this one time when I told my agent, "What I want to do is dramas, no more romcoms." And this $8 million offer comes in, comedy. I read it. I said, "No, thank you." I come back with a $12 million offer. No thanks. $14.5 million offer. I said, "Let me read that again." Ultimately said, "No, I just bought myself a one-way ticket out of Hollywood." About 20 months after offers came in, would those have come if id have never stepped out? No. No. Number four. If you do this, you're most likely going to have some success in life and that is you.

Steven: And what about Admiral Bill McRaven? So he shared great wisdom with me when I was seeking out male mentors. We reached out to Bill and he wrote this letter for you. He said, "Dear Matthew, wow. Are you able to share what you were seeking guidance from him about?

Steven: To my regular listeners, I know you don't like it when I ask you to subscribe at the start of these conversations. I don't like saying it. None of us like it. It's frustrating. Do you know what's also frustrating? When I go into the back end of a YouTube channel and I see that 56% of you that listen frequently to this podcast haven't yet subscribed. So many of you don't even know that you haven't subscribed. You say, "I didn't even realize I didn't subscribe." That actually fuels the show—it's like you're making a donation to the show. That's why I ask: it enables us to build and build. We're going for the long term. If you've seen this show before and you like it, help me and my team—hit the subscribe button and we'll continue to build this show for you. Thank you to all of you that do subscribe. Means the world to me. Let's get on with the show.

Steven: You're a particularly, surprisingly artistic, creative, wise, yet materially successful individual. It wasn't until I dove deeper into your story that I started to understand why you are, to me, an anomaly—you seem to be several things that don't often appear in the same place. My first question: what do I need to understand about your earliest context to understand who you are, your values, and your perspective?

Matthew: Earliest on, basic values of respect yourself, respect others, give a damn about yourself, give a damn about others. Combined with a mother that wherever we went in the world that we might have been a little nervous to take a risk at, she was like, "Don't walk in there like you want to buy the place. Walk in like you own it." A sort of boosting up of what you could say is massive ego—but also you were not allowed to walk on your proverbial toes in our family. You were brought down. If anything, I would say going back, mom and dad maybe could have been a little more lenient with the successes that we had and let when we did parade—when my brother did win the track meet and walk through the house like this—to allow him to do that. You weren't allowed to. You were immediately humbled. No matter if you were coming right off a victory or a box office hit, you weren't allowed to. At the same time, you were raised up once you were humbled. That balance. We were taught resilience—heavy duty resilience. Baseline gratitude. Quit asking me for new shoes. I'm going to introduce you to the kid with no feet. These were aphorisms from my mother. Yeah, but they were pounded into us. I spent 36 years thinking I was little Mr. Texas cuz my mom told me I was, until 36 years later I look at the trophy and it says I was runner up and I go, "Oh, mom was overselling us to ourselves at the same time. You better be humble." It was almost like anything exterior should not give you your identity. Even though my mom's maliprop and fibbing to us going, "You're little Mr. Texas." Or, "Here, write this poem. I know you didn't write it, but it's really good. Turn that in for the seventh grade poetry contest." Okay. And I win. True story. Outlaw logic of my mom and my dad also with work ethic. Hustle, hustle, hustle. Sleep was sin in my household. Sin. I saw my dad asleep one time in my life. I got up at 8:00 on a Saturday morning, went through the kitchen and peaked—saw him sleeping. I woke up my brother: "Dude, dad's still asleep?" He died 2½ months later. I connected that idea that, oh, if he slept in that late, he must have not been feeling well. If it was daylight, you couldn't be inside. Fierce sense of independence. 30 minutes TV a night max. Mom would say, "Why watch someone doing something when you can go do it yourself? Turn that damn thing off. Get outside." You had to be outside. Go hustle. Figure it out. Be home in the dark. That was the rule.

Steven: What about love?

Matthew: We always knew we were loved. Loving each other, loving mom and dad, being loved by mom and dad, and mom would keep on to make sure you're loving yourself. I remember breakups—heartbroken. She’d let us mourn. Great ear, very sensitive to broken hearts. But only for a day. After a day, she'd crank up AC/DC and go, "Now, get up. You're worth it. Her loss. Come on, get out of bed. Quit moping. Lift your head up. Come on, buddy. We got this. Her loss." You get the day. No more than that. Our love was physical. My mom and dad married three times, divorced twice to each other. They fought. I’ve got a story in Greenlights—mom bashing and breaking dad's nose with the phone, him getting angry, her pulling a chef's knife, him dancing around dodging blades, grabbing a ketchup bottle like a matador—touche—splattering it on her. Finally her throwing the knife down, crying, both crying, coming together, embracing, going to the linoleum kitchen floor and making love. No grudges, no grounding. You get in trouble—which we did—we were always guilty—but it was corporal. Take your licks. Get it over with. We're not going to ground you because that'd be taking away your time and your time is the most valuable thing you got. Take your licks. You're not going to get injured. It's going to hurt. And don't yell, cuz if you yell, you're going to get another one. Licks with a belt. "I can't," "I hate," and lying were three things you got in trouble for. If I said, "I can't," my dad's teeth would go, "Excuse me? You sure you're not just having trouble?" One time I couldn't get the lawn mower started. I said, "Dad, I can't get the lawn mower started." He walked out, messed around, 10 minutes—boom—cranked it. While it's running, he bent down: "See, son, you were just having trouble." I said, "I hate you" to my brother at my own birthday party—mom stopped the party, pulled me aside—"You don't ever use that word, especially to family." Gave me licks, dried my tears, resumed the party. So from "don't say can't," I learned: if you're unable, you can still go find help—you were just having trouble. From the butt whoopin' for saying "I hate you," I learned the antonyms, because saying "I can't," lying, and "I hate you" brought pain—the opposite must bring pleasure: tell the truth, love, believe you can. Those values are in my being now. We hugged 999 times more than the hands hurt. Physical, hugging, loving family. Always went to bed with an "I love you" and a kiss. Even if it was ritual, like a Sunday service—you should take a day to be humbled and say thank you to a higher power for the things and people in your life, help those people double down on their great attributes. People hear the knife-and-ketchup story and go, "Oh my god, sorry about your childhood, have you had therapy?" I'm like, "No. Please don't trespass by labeling it abuse. I wasn't abused. I never felt unloved." I feared my parents, yes. There were many things I did not do for fear of consequences, yes. But we knew we were loved. My brothers knew they were loved. My second brother is adopted—he knew he was loved. It was hard love. Tough love. My parents' love was passionate love. Divorced twice, married three times—can't live with you, can't live without you. One thing was crystal clear when I was 8: shaking hands with two guys—later I learned they were dad's collectors—Oak Forest Country Club parking lot. Sun in my eyes, they had shades. "Nice to meet you, sir." In my head: the one common denominator besides being older men is they're all fathers. "Oh, that's what success is. If you become a father, you've succeeded." That stuck. The one thing I always knew I wanted to be was a dad. I meet Camila, fall in love, we make three children—17, 15, 12. There’s no time I spend being a father that I don't feel is the absolute best time I could be spending.

Steven: Outside of wanting to be a father at 8, in your adolescent years—if I’d asked you then what you wanted to be professionally, what would you have said?

Matthew: 15, 16 years old—Washington [__] running back. By 16, playing football, I found I wasn't the fastest nor the biggest. Then it became: I'm told I'm really good at debate. I would win arguments in the family—presentations for where to go, why I could go out. Parents would give us the floor. The word around 15–16 was, "You got to go to law school, buddy. Be the family lawyer. You're really good at arguing. And if it's not a great argument, you’ll outlast people." I enjoyed that and headed toward law school.

Steven: I read about your youth exchange in Australia—that you'd struggled in class and were skipping class to read poems by Lord Byron.

Matthew: I'd graduated high school in Longview. At 18—freedom in my family. If you hadn't learned it yet, you ain't going to. No curfew. Come home when you want. Straight A's. Mom and dad happy. Weekend and after-school job. $45 cash in my pocket. A car, paid for. Dating the best looking girl at my school, seeing the girl at the other school. Playing golf, four handicap, two holes-in-one. No curfew. Green lights—I’m rolling. Don't know exactly what I'll do, but law school's coming. Mom goes, "What about exchange student?" Sweden or Australia. Chose Australia—speaks English and maybe Elle Macpherson's over there. I was told I'd be living on the outskirts of Sydney—turned out it was 3½ hours from there, a very small town—Warner Vale, population 305. Pulling up the gravel driveway, host family: "Welcome to Australia, mate." Not what I thought, but I can make this work. Suddenly, no car, no girlfriend across town, no golf clubs, no money in my pocket. 10 pm curfew even Friday and Saturday. I'm going to school again. Felt like social reverse. They put me in junior year mid-semester so I could carry on to senior year. No one's got a car. Interests different. Teachers—I'm failing. Fs in everything. I start skipping class, going to the library. I find Lord Byron. Walkman with U2's Rattle and Hum, Maxi Priest, and an INXS album. Rattle and Hum—socially conscious: oppression, silver and gold, higher ground, evils of capitalism gone wrong, freeing Nelson Mandela—Bono and U2 are making sense. I'm outside my home on a foreign island; when you leave what you know, you find out what you actually know. I’m seeing that kid I was—money, rolling. I miss that, but I'm also going, you're good-time rolling, popular, everything's great. I had no resistance. Now I’ve got a lot of resistance. No friends to talk to. Awkward relationship with the family. They even wanted me to call them "mum and pup." That was seminal. Many odd things I wrote off as cultural differences, but that night I went, "No. I'm not doing that." First clarity—6 months in. Principals come to see me: "School's not going good for you. We have work experience. Let's get you a job. You won't get paid." I worked at ANZ Bank, a barrister's office, odd carpentry jobs. Home life: dinner at 5–5:30, I clean dishes, back to my room, take a bath, listen to those cassettes, read Lord Byron in the bathtub, work one out, run six miles a day, become vegetarian—lettuce with ketchup—down to 135 lbs. I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to go to South Africa and be a monk. Now I see: I needed disciplines to give me daily measurement—"I’ve got my own thing going"—because I was lost. Writing 16-page letters to myself, returning them with 17-page letters—Socratic letters about huge existential questions mixed with "everything is going great," talking myself into keeping my head up. Why didn't I come home early? I remember: when I said yes to exchange, the ambassador said sign a contract you won't return before a year unless a fatality in family or you're majorly sick. I said, I'm not signing that. I'll give you a handshake—I'm going for the year. I'm not pulling the parachute. Dad told me a handshake is the contract. I had honor in that. No way I was coming home. If I had, I'd have felt I'd done my dad wrong. While I was imploding in Australia, I started to find power in: the harder this gets, the greater the reward on the other side. Staying the year was non-negotiable. I never gave my mind the chance to go, "You could go home." That choice gave me identity. Rest of the year was easier. Some troubles I laughed at. I wasn't going to the bathtub at 5:30 doing what I was doing many times a week. I started to live and dance with it. Writing my first poems. Then life brings me back to Texas to study law.

Steven: Which doesn’t end up working out because in your sophomore year you start questioning yourself—based on this little book.

Matthew: Yep. End of sophomore year. Headed toward law school, going to take finals. Study bug. A's across the board. First time I go, "Dude, you got this. You don't need to study anymore." I shut my books. Never done that. Two hours before my exam, I look over—stack of magazines: Sports Illustrated, Playboys, Penthouse. I don't like sports; I like women—let's check these out. I flip through—nothing. After the seventh magazine, I look down—this book is laying there, in the middle of the stack: "The Greatest Salesman in the World." I said, "Who's that?" I pick it up. First chapter: forming good habits and becoming their slave. I think, if you're going to go against yourself and go to law school just because you "should," that's not a good habit. You might be missing out. You better create a new habit than just doing what you think you're expected to do. I said, I want to go to film school. I don't want to go to law school. Simply because the book mentioned having the habit of doing something just because you think you should or can. It doesn't even say that directly—just, "I will form good habits and become their slave." If I go to law school, that makes me a slave to a bad habit—the bad habit being: you'd be good at it, it's what you're supposed to do, it's all you've ever thought you were doing, it's what everyone expects in the family. But I'm staying up at night. I've also got a friend telling me, your short stories are good, man—you could tell a good story. Filmmaking sounds fun. Then: my dad's paying for school; I gotta get permission first. I planned the call. Not at work—pipe sales. Not Monday night—stressful day. Tuesday night, 7:30—he'll have eaten dinner, on the couch with a beer with mom. I called at 7:36 pm. "Hey Pop." "Hey, what's up, monkey man?" "Listen, can I talk about something?" "Sure." "Dad, I don't want to go to law school anymore. I want to go to film school." Sweat down my back—here it comes. "You want to what?" I thought he'd say, that can be a hobby, not a real job. After about 5 seconds, he goes, "Are you sure that's what you want to do?" "Yes, sir." Long pause. Then: "Well, don't halfass it." I beamed—launchpad. He not only said okay—the way he said "don't half-ass it" was "Let's go, big boy. Own that [__]. Get leverage, get horsepower behind where you're going. Go do it." Later, as a father, I think he heard me say it without stutter—what a parent loves: you raise your kids, give guidelines, so they can succeed. What you really want is for them to call and say, "I'm breaking out. I'm going my own way." As a parent, as much as it scares us, we go, "Yes." He heard me not really asking—out of respect I asked—but I was telling him. "Don't halfass it" became important in relationships, work, self-help, spirituality, as a father, as a husband.

Matthew: Relationship-wise, "own don't rent." Go in with an owner's mindset. Most relationships—assistant, girlfriend, boyfriend—don’t last a lifetime. But go in aiming for lifer—if it doesn't work out, it doesn't. The owner's mentality gives both dignity and power to be everything you can be. If it doesn't work, fine. But with a renter's mentality—"maybe a few weeks, a couple months"—you won't get the most out of that person.

Steven: It's like Australia—you owned the full experience and didn't leave. Married people tell me commitment itself changes how you handle the messiness—the challenge is inbuilt into meaningful things. With a renter mentality, the first red light, you're out. In marriage—"we're owning this"—alarms don't go off. We work through it, or it's a one-off you tolerate because they like to do it more than you dislike it. It begs the question about plan B: we're told to have plan B, C, D, E in relationships and work.

Matthew: Too many options can make a tyrant of any of us. So can conveniences. There are necessary divorces. But I think there are more because someone gave themselves the out—renter's mentality. First sign of smoke, they say fire—easier to get out, path of least resistance. I think too many people quit. That's more of a problem than the divorces that turned out to be good.

Steven: Many people are at a stage where they have that bad habit. They know they're in a situation not for them—maybe parents or society pushed them. The uncertainty keeps them trapped—certain misery is more appealing than uncertainty. You managed to make that change, which is rare.

Matthew: I started to become a little cynical—which is different than skeptical. We go from innocence to naive to skepticism—discernment, judgment. Then off the cliff to cynicism. The misery of cynicism is a lot easier than the optimism and belief of skepticism. It's easy—bam, put it down. "That's hard—I'm out." "If I sweat, don't do it." Easier to put things down, live in doubt, doubt yourself—"I don't want to work that hard. I don't want to try." "If I do try, let's just rent. More than sign a prenup." We give ourselves parachutes in too many places. We pull it early when we could still be flying—even if a rocky flight. "Safe move—got down to the ground. What I was building didn't last." Sometimes it shouldn't. Most of the time, it could if you'd hung in there—both of you.

Steven: Before recording we chatted about how independence and abundance of choice might be leading people astray. The most fulfilled people I know have a lot of dependence. Culture tells us to be your own boss; more people are lonely, fewer friends, less likely to have kids or get married. A friend—38, picture of independence—skyrise apartment, single, no kids, freelancer, working from home—6 months later he flies to America, is baptized, tells me he couldn't get out of bed for months. Now he's strongly Christian. We're seeing more young men turn to religion. What's going on?

Matthew: Let's stay on young men (not excluding women). We want and need to be relied on. We want and need to be depended on. A sheer independent lifestyle with nothing you're responsible for outside yourself—no other gardens to tend, career or relational, no collective or communal responsibilities—who relies on us? How much do we need to rely on others? I don't know that answer. Self-reliance is at the top of my value system and I don't think it contradicts faith. Free will and faith are here together. As a believer, I believe it's all been written, and at the same time, I believe God's going, "I need your hands on the wheel. You're steering this. Don't just rely on fate." Too many people do. I've had agnostic years—fully self-reliant. Valuable years. I needed to call myself on some [__]. The buck stops with you, McConaughey. Quit being a repeat offender. I was sinning—missing the mark—bad aim—archery term. Thinking of it that way makes it practical. I was missing and didn't want to keep forgiving myself on Sunday and then repeat the same [__] Monday to Friday and then be forgiven again. "Forgive me, father, I know what I'm doing and I keep doing it." Cut the [__], MCA. Quit giving yourself that parachute. Even though the word says grace will forgive you, I needed to strong-arm myself—hands on the wheel, look in the mirror—it's on you. Later, I realized those two aren't exclusive. I heard God applauding: "Thank you. Your choices matter."

Steven: What caused that late-20s drift? You’d had your first success as an actor.

Matthew: I gave myself the luxury of fully independent—top of the penthouse. Money. Checked in at the Chateau Marmont—put down a $120,000 tab—"Let me know when that's out." Me and my dog. Bought leather pants and a motorcycle. Told myself for two years: if you ever think you've had too many, order another one. If you think maybe a single, order a double. I exercised it as healthily as I could, but I was sheerly independent. Transient. Fun. But when every day is Saturday and every night is Saturday night, I started looking for: I need to break a sweat. Where's the resistance? I need my Monday morning—literally and spiritually.

Steven: Did the loss of your father in your 20s have a big impact on this unanchoring?

Matthew: No—the loss of the father dropped the anchor deeper and got more secure. 1992—five days into shooting my first film, Dazed and Confused. I didn't think he could die—obviously, he did. It took my mother to kill him—as you know from the story. They made love on a Monday morning. He had a heart attack. Not a bad way to go. He called it. He told me and my brothers, "Boys, when I go, I'm going to be making love to your mother." And he did. Him passing—after the morning shock—woke me up: you don't have that one being in your life that has your back—above government, above religion. "If I'm in a pinch, dad's got my back." You don't have that anymore, Matthew. All the things he taught you—time to become those and put your ass on the line. I carved into a tree in the middle of the night: "Be less impressed and more involved." My father passing—the world got flat. Things I revered—people, places—came down to eye level. Things I was patronizing and condescending toward rose to eye level. Time to become a man. Walk forward. Peripheral vision. Own yourself. More courage. Become the man you want to be instead of acting like it and putting it off. Be less impressed and more involved.

Steven: What did you mean by that?

Matthew: We grew up hardcore on gratitude. I'm thankful. But you can't stop there. If you're only happy to be here—"thank you for having me"—you can't be present and involved to do it as well as you want. "Thank you for letting me be here, and I'm supposed to be here. Now let's go." If I'm just happy to be here, I can't have this conversation. I'm not grounded enough to be here. I'd anticipate my thoughts, say only the pretty stuff, avoid the ugly or mean. Being involved allowed me to be more honest and have more courage. When we're involved, we're more honest and courageous to do what we're fashioned to do. If we're only impressed—I had those moments. I met the Coen brothers—my favorite directors. Had dinner. I blew it—fumbled over my wife. I was nervous—so happy to be there—impressed, not involved. I look back and go, that's why they never cast me. I've since seen them—I want a do-over.

Steven: Transferable advice for me as a podcaster and for job interviews—you can lower perceived value by being impressed, not involved.

Matthew: Probably won't get hired that way either.

Steven: What hiring wants is someone respectful, not reverential. I don't need my ass kissed. I want to meet you. I don't want you to agree with me on everything. Buck back—with reasons, not contrarian for contrarian's sake. In relationships, too—we want someone with ideas.

Steven: This picture—your father holding court—tell me about it.

Matthew: That's my oldest brother Rooster on the right. That's Pat—Rooster's 10-year-old birthday present—adopted. Went to meet his parents when he was 17. Check his dad's hairline. That's me looking down on my father holding court at the bar in the house, Quail Valley, Houston, Texas. Looks like he got off the golf course. I have a t-shirt; they have golf shirts—looks like I didn't play with them then. Stories going on about something they experienced. I'm probably thinking, "I wish I was there," which only happened for me once I turned 18. Look at the reverence with which I'm looking at my dad—he was a ham. He and Rooster were best friends. Pat worked for him. We had a summer together—later I found out it was their second divorce. I thought mom was on an extended vacation in Florida.

Steven: Do you miss him?

Matthew: Creatively the most. We found old paintings and pottery he made—he collected art, loved charcoal and pencil black-and-white. I had no idea. When I'm reading a script or interested in a film, I still think, I'd love to have sent this to dad—"What do you think? Know anybody like this? What do you think of this character? This scenario? Know any men like this?" Many characters are based on people I met through him—parts of my brother Pat, or people through my older brother Rooster—but all came through dad. I miss those conversations. He would have loved the Toronto Film Festival premiere—my mom in it (93), my son in it—he would have come to Santa Fe with mom. Mom wants to be on the stage—"You did great, Matthew; I see where you get it from." Dad didn't want the stage; he could take it, but he'd be front row: "There you go, buddy." I miss him as a creative partner and sharing declarations—red carpets and his opinion. Watching movies—we never watched movies. I miss that. His hands—healing hands. We'd have been buddies by now. Philosophically, we'd enjoy debates instead of "Who the hell do you think you are?" at 16. At 18—freedom—"If you ain't learned it by now, you ain't gonna." We'd have years of stories together.

Steven: Would he have been surprised by your life?

Matthew: No. My family's not surprised by [__]. Especially my success. My brothers haven't even seen all my movies. If I invited them to the Toronto premiere, they'd find every excuse not to go. They don't love me less—it's "We know you, little brother."

Steven: Do you remember these? You wrote this around '92—your 10 goals in life.

Matthew: I wouldn't change a thing. 10 goals: Become a father. Find and keep a woman for me. Keep my relationship with God. Chase my best self. Be an egotistical utilitarian. Take more risks. Stay close to mom and family. Win an Oscar for best actor. Look back and enjoy the view. Just keep living.

Steven: You’ve said you need resistance.

Matthew: It's a necessity. Boundaries give form. Limitations reveal style. If life is nothing but green lights—no yellows and reds, no reasons to pause—do you just go in circles, run out of gas, get dizzy? How do we evolve without resistance? Picking the right resistance is an art. I've been clumsy—when I got famous and had success and enough people telling me "I love you," caviar and champagne—I was like, "Why me? I don't deserve this." I'd [__] things up on purpose, trip myself running downhill to bloody my own nose and go, "Ah, now I can feel." That's clumsy. We don't need resistance we create that harms us. When things are going well, resistance is going to come—if you have ambition.

Steven: We avoid resistance—comfort crisis: loneliness, back pain—choosing comfort is a short-term friend, long-term enemy. Resistance is increasingly optional.

Matthew: I wrote "Tips Included"—participation trophies, entitlement, how too much can be as harmful as not enough. We all need charity sometimes, but shouldn't rely on it. [Recites poem.]

Steven: That's so good—about conveniences and long lenses. What's AI going to do to us?

Matthew: Talk about convenience. How much of valuable learning comes from writing and rewriting—wrestling ideas beyond an intellectual "there it is"? We can use AI as signposts and organizers, but there’s value in sweat equity of learning.

Steven: Studies with chatbots show when people use AI to produce work they recall less and start speaking more like the AI—lose their own voice. Richard Feynman said: learn it, compress to a simple truth, share it, get feedback. AI is great for saying something to you, not for me learning it. Choose easy today, hard tomorrow; unintended consequences.

Matthew: Do you think if you choose hard today, you usually get easy tomorrow?

Steven: In many contexts, yes. My father avoided conflict; that cost him big. I invert—confront it head on—opposite effect. You realigned yourself calling your father about film. If you hadn't, at 40 you'd say, "Who is this life?" That course correction requires doing the harder thing today.

Matthew: That's chosen resistance. I still need to learn how to take a vacation. Sometimes the wind's at our back and we've earned it. Easy street—don't interrupt it. Trust the hill's coming again. Don't be too impressed; don't force resistance. My hunch: shoot for an A and make a C is better than shooting for a C and making an F. Go for perfection; reality comes under it. How quickly can we accept reality and see we got so much more because we aimed high? I've never done a performance that lived up to the divine. It may be inspiring, speak to masses, have some magic—but only the divine is divine. That tension—the unclosed gap—fuels the next thing.

Steven: If you aimed for perfect and it delivered perfect—would that make you happy or scared?

Matthew: Both. Story: Mali, Dogon country—my buddy Issa and I hiking village to village. They love wrestling. I used the name David—"Da"—a writer and a boxer. They didn't care about the writing—very interested in wrestling. I get to a village—Benji Matu. Two boys talk trash. The real champion, Michel—5' something, tree trunk legs, burlap bag around his waist—shows up. He points to me, himself, the dirt pit. Heart racing. "If you don't accept this, you'll regret it." I get up. The chief puts hands on our heads, we grab waists, foreheads in clavicles—Tot! We go. I flip him; he flips me; leg lock; I shimmy out. Chief separates; I'm hyperventilating, bleeding; he's barely glistening. Round two—strong match—chief raises both hands. They put me on shoulders. Best chair, biggest chicken, cleanest river. That night on the roof—I see the Southern Cross—29 shooting stars in 30 minutes. I feel like the chosen one. Just as I shut my eyes, I spit—lugie plasters my face. I’d forgotten my mosquito net. Perfect. Next morning, Michel silently pops out from the first tree, bows, grabs my hand, walks me 14 miles to the next village border, and walks home. Six years later, I return—Michel has five kids, broke his hip—limp. We agree no rematch. Next morning he does the same walk. Issa said after the first time: "When you accepted the challenge, that is when you were big man in this tribe. Not win or lose. You wrestled Michel—champion of this and three villages back—and you handled Michel. You come back, we make money." Accepting the challenge made you big.

Steven: Many young men are struggling; suicide letters often express feeling unneeded or that people are better off without you. Challenge and resistance are being removed.

Matthew: If today’s challenges don't pay back qualitatively, we need immortal ones: belief in God, belief in our better selves, our character and dignity, relationships, tomorrow, our past, our kids—measured not in mortal currency, but pursuits that give life meaning while we do other things.

Steven: In Poems and Prayers, you confront science vs. faith. How do you see it?

Matthew: Science is the practical pursuit of God. It ain't ever going to get there, but bravo. God loves a scientist. Believe is a verb; faith is a verb. A scientist may say: I must doubt what cannot be proven. That doesn't contradict belief in God—even though you can't conclude God exists. I know plenty of scientists who are believers. Practically: heaven or not, tomorrow is not today's measurement when the misery is bad enough. Consideration is a privilege. Faith helps those in misery hang on to hope that won't be served in this life—belief they'll be served in the next. What if there's nothing there? Either way—in misery here or without a heaven there—not having any hope is a way to remain where you are. If you can find something, no matter how small, to look forward to and have faith in, your life here will be better—heaven or not. I'm not trying to convert anyone. Religion's been bastardized. Religion—from re‑ligare—"bind together again"—restoration and unity. I have spiritual friends who say they're not religious—what they want is unity. We made religion a business. I don't believe Muhammad, Jesus, or God say "Yeah, that's fine." Let's restore the original meaning and live that way instead of accepting what it's become. Poems and Prayers came because I got a little cynical—objectifying people, looking down my nose, and listening to leaders say: if you can get success by lying, cheating, and stealing, you still get the gold medal. Are we ready to accept "just win"? If you follow the rules, you're a sucker. I'm not ready to wave the white flag.

Steven: Your writing reframes success—be careful what that medal represents and in what game you win.

Matthew: We’re trained that quantity is the goal. If that sacrifices quality and value—what are you winning? You’re winning a mortal game. I also recognize my privilege—some can't afford long-term thinking. I'm still learning from them.

Steven: Independence might have failed us. The happiest have dependence; the struggling have most independence. I’m writing "I Can’t Find God"—maybe we need to ladder up: me, family, community, planet, transcendent. People that don't ladder up seem lost.

Matthew: If we make God (or being more divine) our North Star, through humility and courage, peace of mind, the sense that "this isn't all there is," we play the immortal game. Risks are easier; you're not looking forward to dying, but not that afraid of it. Selfishness and selflessness are in bed together; humility and confidence hook up.

Steven: When your children ask how to succeed—what’s transferable? Your career hit the top again and again—DNA or something else?

Matthew: Start with innate ability—what's in your DNA. I wanted to dunk—wasn’t going to. Then pursue an education—work, hustle—for that which you have an innate ability. If we’re talking making a living—does the world demand it? Supply and demand. If you can do something you have innate ability for, you get good at it, and the world demands it, there you go. Some have innate ability but don't work, rely on what they got, end up middle of the field. Sometimes you don't have ability, but you learn a new craft and hustle—get good, and learn to love it.

Steven: You stepped back from romcom stardom and reoriented to substance.

Matthew: If something’s not sitting right in my soul—even if I’m pulling it off—and it’s not translating, I change. I was getting quantity, not quality. I felt like I could do it tomorrow. Nothing wrong with that—that’s earned—but I needed resistance. I fell in love with Camila; she’s pregnant. I always wanted to be a father. Life is vital. I wanted dramas; Hollywood wouldn’t offer them, even with a pay cut. So I quit doing what I'd been doing—went to the ranch in Texas. Camila’s pregnant. Told my agent no more romcoms. We didn't know how long it would last. Decision was non-negotiable.

Steven: You got offered a lot of money in that time.

Matthew: Yeah. $8M—no thank you. $10M—no. $12M—no. $14.5M—"Let me read that again." Same words as $8M, but better written, funnier. I could see myself in it. Ultimately—no. I think me saying no to $14.5M a year into saying no more romcoms sent a message around Hollywood: "McConaughey’s not bluffing. He's stepped out. He turned down $14.5M. He's not for rent." Maybe that made me more attractive. "You know who might be great for this drama?" Lincoln Lawyer. Killer Joe. Mud. Dallas Buyers Club. Magic Mike. True Detective. 20 months after I stepped out, those offers came in. I grabbed all I could. Would those have come if I had never stepped out? Not even maybe—no.

Steven: Success can become a prison. You did something drastic to realign.

Matthew: Yeah. Turned down $14.5M—my brothers thought I was malfunctioning. But I remembered how I felt when we made the covenant—no matter how long, we're not going back. Endurance. Australia and this story remind me: I could have pulled the parachute sensibly—after three months in Australia, or after a year out of the business with my agent saying, "I haven't heard your name in four months." Why start a new job? Just go back—romcoms waiting.

Steven: The through line is you knew who you were—and were not.

Matthew: I knew who I was not. In Australia, I wasn't going to be the guy who breaks a handshake. With career, I suspected the longer the penance, the greater the gift. Did I trick myself? Probably. Did I post it on my mental fridge like a mantra? Yes. It took a while to become belief.

Steven: You have a good relationship with uncertainty.

Matthew: I hope so. My wife might say I need to work on it. Many wait for 100% certainty. I've had projects with best-laid plans turn out poorly, projects under-financed that turned out great. Dallas Buyers Club—$4.9M in 25 days. We turned it into that. It was never "real"—we just said, "We ought to say we're doing this in October," and kept saying it. There was no money. My agent: "You're not doing it in October." I'd say, "Yes we are." Scripts came in—"Read this for that slot." "No, we're doing Dallas." "Dude, you're not—no date, no money." "We’re doing Dallas." We didn't manifest it—we just didn't flinch. We were aligned. People started to believe it.

Steven: Has conviction—saying things without flinching—proven important?

Matthew: Yes. Different from "fake it till you make it." Words are momentary; intent is momentous. We overcompensated with cancel culture—hammered for the word without asking, "Do you understand my intent?" Especially for people who are ignorant—didn't know better—give amnesty. The bad agents who know good from evil and choose evil—different. Have we forgotten to say, "Sorry, my bad, stuck my foot in my mouth"? If I do it again next week, shame on me—repeat offender. You can forgive me but don't trust me—ask for reparations, rehab. If you forgive me and believe I'm truly sorry and will try not to do it again, first order of business is I change my behavior so I don't have to come say sorry again.

Steven: There's an incentive to misunderstand people now—likes and follows. That's not the resistance we're talking about.

Matthew: Trying to misunderstand people—what for? To be controversial? To be significant? To trump someone's gesture? We’ve got to compare before we contrast. Make the positives plural and the negative singular—block the negative’s path to prophecy. Talk about bad [__] in the past tense; talk about positives in present and future—keep that ball going.

Steven: What season of life are you in now?

Matthew: The last eight years I’ve come to love fall. I grew up a summer guy—no shirt, no shoes, bright lights, extrovert. I've come to like fall because I'm interested in many things, and my hunch is not to take on more campfires, but to keep putting logs on fires I've built. The clouds that come with fall nip ambition a bit—put a little roof. I'm not a big fan of the 30-foot vault ceiling right now. I like the 10-footer, the 8-footer. I feel ambitious looking laterally instead of four-dimensionally. I'm looking for the dreams and the poems and the prayers to become reality. I like a little shade.

Steven: Our closing tradition: What is your greatest weakness? What is your greatest strength?

Matthew: A lot of times they're the same. People say my greatest asset is risk. I think I need to be taking a lot more risks. I'm successful. I got a home, a gate, a security guard, three kids, a wife. Secure this. Keep logs on those fires going—that's the main thing. But you still need to engage. Kids need to see you go to work, come with you, see you and mom go places without them. Engage the world, find new things, learn new things—physical frontier or mental—take more risk there to learn. Mark Waters, director of Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, told me, "You're never wrong. But there's more than one way to be right." One asset: when I'm certain, I can commit; it's an engine of momentum. Downside: I can leave unnecessary shrapnel with people I care about because I'm so committed to this truth that I block alternative approaches—I don't have the confidence to go, "Let me see that," because I think if I see that, I'll lose some of this. I'm working on that.

Steven: We reached out to Bill McRaven, and he wrote a letter for you… [reads letter].

Matthew: Wow. Thank you, Bill. I spoke to him before I went to DC after Uvalde. Wisdom with context—understand politics, but go your line. Beautiful to hear. I didn't know he thought all those things. I'll give him a hug over coffee or tequila. Good man.

Steven: Everything he says rings true from everyone I know. You're a great role model for me and for many. Thank you for Poems and Prayers and for standing for family, faith, resistance, empathy, grace, kindness, and respect.
